      <div class="about-body">
        <p>Having held many jobs related to the outdoors and managing natural resources, I am a recent addition to the tech community. The one constant in my various roles has been the need to learn new skills and adapt to different work flows. That's perhaps one of the things that interests me most about web and software development, it will both allow and require that I continue to learn throughout my entire career. I am resourceful and accustomed to working with minimal supervision as well as an experienced collaborative and communicative team member.</p>

      <div class="about-body">
        <p>With a background of working for family-run farms, non-profits and small businesses, I enjoy connecting with those I work with and being a part of a team and organization that truly cares about the work they do. I am currently enrolled in a full stack web development bootcamp through Epicodus with the projection to graduate in December 2022. In it I am learning HTML, CSS, Boostrap, C#, .NET, and REACT.js.</p>

          <p>This was our first group project after finishing the <em>Javascript</em> section of bootcamp. It's a game application utlizing two different quotes <em>API</em>s to randomly generate quotes and possible answers for the user to guess.  Utilizing <em>OOP</em>, it keeps track of usernames and scores adds the user to the leaderboard if they have a high score. It was built with <em>Webpack</em> and we were able to add some <em>JS libraries</em> for animations and sound effects.</p>

It is an app for a fictional bakery to keep track of orders from its various vendors. Also uses <em>Razor</em> for webpage display.  Soon to be refactored to include a database on <em>mySQL</em> with communication via the <em>Entity Framework</em>.</dd>
